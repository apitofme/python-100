# Slide 2: Solution
print("1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.")
print("2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.")
print("3. Add 3g of Salt.")
print("4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.")
print("5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.")

# Slide 3: Print Modifiers
# - Problems arise when we want to use quotes inside our print statement
print("She said: "Hello" and then left.")
# - Sometimes we can fix this by using different quotes (single/double)
print('She said: "Hello" and then left.')
# - Alternatively we could use an 'escape character' to ignore a symbol
print("She said: \"Hello\" and then left.")

# Slide 4: Single-quotes, Double-quotes and Escaping with '\'
print("A 'single quote' inside a double quote")
print('A "double quote" inside a single quote')
print("Alternatively you can just \"escape\" the quote")
