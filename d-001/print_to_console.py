# A Brave New Line:
# - introducing the "new-line" character '\n'
print("Hello world!\nHello world!")

# On The Plus Side:
# - combining strings using '+'
print("Hello" + "Python")
# - Note this will actually output "HelloPython" with no space,
#   but we can add a space using any of the following methods
print("Hello " + "Python")
print("Hello" + " Python")
print("Hello" + " " + "Python")

# Python's Personal Space Issues:
# - Python is very fussy about how space is used when writing code
    print("Hello" + "Python")
    # - Note that this results in an "IndentationError"
 print("Hello" + "Python")
 # - Even a single space wrong and it's Game Over!
