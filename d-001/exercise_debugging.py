"""
# - Added the missing opening double-quote before the word 'Day'.
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# - Changed the outer double-quotes to single-quotes to not clash with "+"
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
# - Removed the incorrect indentation
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# - Removed the extra '(' at the opening print function parenthesis
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
