Slide 1: Task
- Write a program to convert student scores in to grades

The student scores 'database' will be given as a Dictionary, where the
student Names will be the Keys and the scores are the Values.

Your program should return a new Dictionary called 'student_grades' with
the student Names as Keys but now with the assigned grades as the Values.

This is the scoring criteria:
    - Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
    - Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
    - Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
    - Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

* DO NOT modify the 'student_scores' dictionary!
* DO NOT write any print statements!
